#Bug List
1) Tennis balls appear to not launch with as much force
2) Trajectory posearray is of Time, X, Z, and really that isn't what we want in RVIZ, we want XYZ, so, I need to publish a new xyz.  

# Improvements
1) Build new house
2) Make Dog Move (gather Balls?)
3) Update trajectory planner to check ground impact point to make sure map is clear
4) (Lan) to update collision checker for 3 inches in Point Cloud (or something along those lines) to refine the collision detection
